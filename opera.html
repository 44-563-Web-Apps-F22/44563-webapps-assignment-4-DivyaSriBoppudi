        <h3>The Gondoliers</h3>
        <h4>ACT II Pavilion in the Palace of Barataria</h4>
        <p style="color:green">SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and
            Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,
            occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers
            are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,
            etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various
            degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social
            distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some
            reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.
          </p>
        <p><b>CHORUS.</b><br>Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.</p>
        <p style="color:red">(Exeunt all but Marco and Giuseppe.)</p>
        <p><b>GIU.</b><br>  Yes, it really is a very pleasant existence.  They're
            all so singularly kind and considerate.  You don't find them
            wanting to do this, or wanting to do that, or saying "It's my
            turn now."  No, they let us have all the fun to ourselves, and
            never seem to grudge it.</p>
        <p><b>MAR.</b><br>It makes one feel quite selfish. It almost seems like
            taking advantage of their good nature.</p>
        <p><b>GIU.</b><br> How nice they were about the double rations.</p>
        <p><b>MAR.</b><br>  Most considerate.  Ah! there's only one thing wanting
            to make us thoroughly comfortable.</p>
        <p><b>GIU.</b><br>  And that is?</p>
        <p><b>MAR.</b><br> The dear little wives we left behind us three months
            ago.</p>
        <p><b>GIU.</b><br>  Yes, it is dull without female society.  We can do
            without everything else, but we can't do without that.</p>
        <p><b>MAR.</b><br>  And if we have that in perfection, we have everything.
            There is only one recipe for perfect happiness.</p>
