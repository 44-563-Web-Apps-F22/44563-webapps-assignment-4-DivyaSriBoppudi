        <p style="color:green">SCENE — Outer Walls and Courtyard of Castle Adamant.  Melissa,
            SachaRissa, and ladies discovered, armed with

        <p class="song"> Death to the invader!
            Strike a deadly blow,
            As an old Crusader
            Struck his Paynim foe!
            Let our martial thunder
            Fill his soul with wonder,
            Tear his ranks asunder,
            Lay the tyrant low!
            Death to the invader!
            Strike a deadly blow,
            As an old Crusader
            Struck his Paynim foe!

        <p class="speech">I like your spirit, girls! We have to meet
            Stern bearded warriors in fight to-day;
            Wear naught but what is necessary to
            Preserve your dignity before their eyes,
            And give your limbs full play.

            <p class="speech"> One moment, ma'am,
                Here is a paradox we should not pass
                Without inquiry. We are prone to say
                "This thing is Needful — that, Superfluous"—
                Yet they invariably co-exist!
                We find the Needful comprehended in
                The circle of the grand Superfluous,
                Yet the Superfluous cannot be brought
                Unless you're amply furnished with the Needful.
                These singular considerations are—
            </p>
        <h5 class="princess">PRI:</h5>
        <p class="speech"> Superfluous, yet not Needful — so you see
            The terms may independently exist.
            <p class="direction">(To Ladies)</p> Women of Adamant, we have to show
            That women, educated to the task,
            Can meet Man, face to face, on his own ground,
            And beat him there. Now, let us set to work;
            Where is our lady surgeon?

            Of those that fall.
